   squashfs images built with Packer and Ansible and delivered through a DevOps
   pipeline
   - Automated AWS deployments with Terraform, auto-scaling groups, and Ansible
   - Deployed mission software with Gitops paradigms using Helm, Kubernetes,
   and Docker
   - Fully automated DevOps pipeline connecting multiple development factories
   to multiple sites
   - Improved baseline release process to increase release cadence from 6
   months to bi-weekly through the use of semantic versioning, trunk-based
   development, and automation tooling
   - Designed and created dynamic deployment tooling to baseline, provision,
   and maintain mission environments across multiple clouds (100+ environments
   deployed, all running baselined versions of factory-delivered artifacts and
   forked configuration templates)

**VMware | March 2013 – June 2016** \
*Senior Consultant*

   - Provided professional services consulting (specialized in VMware
   Integrated OpenStack (VIO) and hybrid-cloud design / implementation)
